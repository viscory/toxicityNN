# toxicityNN

This was a submission for ESTR3108's course project assessment. The dataset was simply a matrix representation of the bonding of molecules. The neural net architecture used conv2D as the main model and achieved 95% weighted accuracy.
You can find a jupyter notebook in this repo detailing my attempts at trying to get this model to work.
